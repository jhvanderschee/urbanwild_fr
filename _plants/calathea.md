  <p>If the 'regular' Calathea is special, Calathea Bicajoux Gecko is
  extraordinary. The stunning leaves on this plant have a painterly quality
  about them and the pinkish flowers are equally beautiful. Did you know that
  the flowers can last up to twenty weeks?</p><p>The Calathea is native to the
  Amazon Rainforest in South America and grows on the forest floor, where
  there's plenty of shade. It thrives in shady spots. This is a stunning and
  decorative plant with variegated foliage.</p><p>What makes it even more unique
  is that it 'whispers': the plant closes its leaves at night and opens them
  again in the morning, which is sometimes accompanied by a rustling sound.
  These plants are excellent air purifiers.</p>

    description_html: >-
      <p>Calathea Warscewiczii may have the trickiest name of them all, but it's
      also one of the most unusual plants. The leaves are extremely soft, almost
      velvety. This plant is nicknamed the 'peacock plant' because of the
      decorative purple colour on the underside of the leaves and the emerald
      colour on top.</p>

      They range in colour from light green to grey-green on top and deep red on
      the bottom.</p>

      <p>Were those spots a mistake by Mother Nature? Not at all! The striking
      pattern is what makes Calathea Insigne so unique! The underside of the
      leaf is a fresh green colour with dark green spots.</p>

      <p>Makoyana is one of the most striking Calatheas, with silver-green to
      olive green leaves that fade to a reddish colour. If you look closely
      you'll see dark green lines on either side of the midrib. The underside of
      the leaf is also worth a closer look. It is silvery white with reddish
      purple spots.</p>

      broad leaves and wide spotted veins. The white veins against a neutral
      green background make this Calathea particularly striking.</p>
