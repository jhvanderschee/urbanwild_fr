Look at your plant through a grower's eyes. Your plants will need more water on hot, sunny days. Feel the dirt to see if your plant needs some extra water. You can also lift it up. If the pot feels lighter, you can add some water. Make sure there's no water in the outer pot; plants can't swim and will drown in no time! Does your plant look a bit peaked? If so, you could consider moving it to a shadier spot. If it doesn't get a lot of sunlight, it may need some extra plant feed. Good luck!
